What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and constraints that a software system must satisfy. It serves as the critical bridge between business stakeholders and the development team, ensuring that everyone has a shared understanding of what the software should accomplish.

Key Aspects of Requirement Analysis:
Requirements Elicitation: The process of gathering information from stakeholders through interviews, workshops, surveys, and observation to understand their needs and expectations.

Requirements Documentation: Systematically recording the requirements in clear, unambiguous language using various formats such as user stories, use cases, functional specifications, and technical requirements.

Requirements Analysis: Examining requirements for consistency, completeness, feasibility, and testability while identifying any conflicts or gaps.

Requirements Validation: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and that all parties agree on the requirements before development begins.

Requirements Management: Maintaining and tracking requirements throughout the project lifecycle, handling changes through a formal process to avoid scope creep.

Importance in SDLC:
Requirement Analysis is critically important in the SDLC for several reasons:

Foundation for Development: It establishes the blueprint that guides all subsequent development activities, reducing the risk of building the wrong product.

Cost Efficiency: Identifying requirements early helps prevent expensive changes during later stages of development.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is critical in SDLC for three key reasons:

Prevents Costly Changes: Identifying and clarifying requirements early minimizes expensive modifications during development or after deployment.

Ensures Stakeholder Alignment: Creates a shared understanding between clients, users, and developers about what the software should accomplish.

Forms Foundation for Quality: Clear requirements enable accurate testing, validation, and ultimately deliver a product that meets user needs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### 1. Requirement Gathering
Requirement gathering involves collecting information from stakeholders about their needs, expectations, and constraints for the software system. This process typically uses techniques like interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation to ensure all relevant requirements are captured.

### 2. Requirement Elicitation
Requirement elicitation focuses on extracting hidden or unexpressed needs from stakeholders through techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and use case analysis. It helps uncover deeper requirements that stakeholders may not have explicitly stated.

### 3. Requirement Documentation
Requirement documentation involves systematically recording requirements in clear, unambiguous formats such as user stories, functional specifications, and technical requirements documents. This creates a reference point for all stakeholders throughout the development process.

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Requirement analysis and modeling involves organizing, prioritizing, and structuring requirements while identifying relationships, dependencies, and potential conflicts. Modeling techniques like UML diagrams, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams help visualize requirements.

### 5. Requirement Validation
Requirement validation ensures that documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible to implement. This involves reviews, walkthroughs, and formal sign-offs to confirm requirements are complete, consistent, and testable before development begins.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the system should do - the specific behaviors, functions, and features it must provide. These are typically actions the system must perform to meet user needs.

**Examples for Booking Management Project:**
- Users shall be able to search for available rooms by date range and room type
- The system shall allow users to create new bookings by selecting dates, room type, and guest information
- Users shall be able to view, modify, and cancel existing bookings
- The system shall automatically calculate total booking costs including taxes and fees
- Admin users shall be able to update room availability and pricing

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform rather than what it should do. These define quality attributes, constraints, and performance characteristics of the system.

**Examples for Booking Management Project:**
- The system shall respond to user requests within 2 seconds under normal load conditions
- User data and payment information shall be encrypted using AES-256 encryption
- The system shall support concurrent access by at least 1000 users without performance degradation
- The booking interface shall be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- System uptime shall be 99.9% during business hours (8 AM - 10 PM local time)

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of the interactions between users (actors) and a system. They illustrate the system's functionality from the user's perspective, showing various use cases (goals) that actors can perform within the system.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Provide a high-level overview of system functionality
- Help identify system actors and their roles
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders and developers
- Serve as a foundation for creating test cases
- Help identify requirements and system scope

### Booking System Use Case Diagram:

**Actors:**
- Guest (Unauthenticated User)
- Registered User
- Administrator
- Payment Gateway (External System)

**Use Cases:**
- Search for Available Rooms
- Create Account/Register
- Login to System
- Make Booking Reservation
- View Booking Details
- Modify Existing Booking
- Cancel Booking
- Process Payment
- Manage Room Inventory (Admin)
- Generate Reports (Admin)
- Manage User Accounts (Admin)


## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders, users, or customers. They define the boundaries of a user story or requirement and provide clear, testable conditions that determine when a feature is complete.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria:
- Provide clarity and eliminate ambiguity about requirements
- Serve as the basis for acceptance testing
- Help developers understand what to build
- Ensure alignment between stakeholders and development teams
- Reduce rework by clearly defining what "done" means
- Facilitate estimation and planning

### Example: Checkout Feature Acceptance Criteria

**Feature:** As a registered user, I want to complete my booking by going through a checkout process so I can confirm my reservation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Given** I have selected a room and dates, **when** I proceed to checkout, **then** I should see a summary of my booking details including room type, dates, and total cost.

2. **Given** I am at the checkout page, **when** I review my information, **then** I should be able to modify my booking dates or room selection before payment.

3. **Given** I am a guest user, **when** I reach checkout, **then** I should be prompted to create an account or continue as guest.

4. **Given** I am at the payment section, **when** I enter payment information, **then** the system should validate card details (number, expiry date, CVV) in real-time.

5. **Given** I have entered valid payment information, **when** I click "Complete Booking", **then** the system should process payment and display a confirmation page with booking reference number.

6. **Given** a payment failure occurs, **when** I try to complete booking, **then** the system should display a clear error message and allow me to try again with different payment method.

7. **Given** I have completed checkout, **when** the transaction is successful, **then** I should receive a confirmation email with booking details within 5 minutes.

8. **Given** I am at checkout, **when** I abandon the process, **then** my selected room should be held for 15 minutes before releasing back to inventory.



Stakeholder Alignment: Ensures all stakeholders have a common understanding of what will be delivered, minimizing misunderstandings and disputes.

Quality Assurance: Clear requirements provide the basis for testing and validation, ensuring the final product meets expectations.

Risk Mitigation: Helps identify potential problems early in the process when they are easier and less costly to address.
